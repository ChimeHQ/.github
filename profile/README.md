We like modular, open source components.

If you are looking for some help using our stuff, issues or discussions work great. Both a [Matrix space](https://matrix.to/#/%23chimehq%3Amatrix.org) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/esFpX6sErJ) are available for live help, but we have a strong bias towards answering in the form of documentation.
